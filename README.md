# Gallery Project
I created this project with react + typescript + styled-components + firebase.

You can do upload and see your photo. Only accept format images png, jpg and jpeg.

## Know-how
I used the useState and useEffect to refresh all photos after upload.

All firebase query fuctions are separeted in one file. So when you need change "database/storage", you just need alter one file.

## Required
Node.js
NPM

## How to install?
-`npm install`

## How to run?
-`npm start`

Thanks
